# About
This project is a toy compiled language. The goals of this project are to
- Create a compiled programming language with syntax and semantics that allows it to be read as english
text in a markdown viewer.
- Improve my understanding of compilers and the mechanisms that they use
- Get better at Rust and Assembly
- Tentatively, I also want to bootstrap a compiler in the language

# Resources
I am using "[Writing a C Compiler](https://norasandler.com/2017/11/29/Write-a-Compiler.html)"
(blogposts by Nora Sandler) and "[An Incremental Approach to Compiler Construction](http://scheme2006.cs.uchicago.edu/11-ghuloum.pdf) "
(paper by Abdulaziz Ghuloum) as starting points for how to write a lexer, parser, and compiler.
